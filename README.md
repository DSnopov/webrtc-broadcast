## Working draft

### Configure your JetBrains IDE to support Nunjucks syntax

1. Go to Preferences > Plugins > Install JetBrains plugin
2. Find the Twig plugin and install it
3. Go to Preferences > Editor > File Types
4. Find the Twig file type and add one more custom extension "*.nunj"

Now all the *.nunj files are parsed as Twig (the template engine identical to Nunjucks).
